## 🎉 Conclusion

This analysis provides a complete roadmap for wiring the Payvost Web application. The application has excellent UI/UX and a robust backend architecture. The main gap is the integration layer between them.

**Key Takeaway:** Most features are 90% complete. The remaining 10% is wiring them to the backend, which is estimated at 8-10 weeks for full integration, or 2-3 weeks for an MVP.

**Recommended Next Step:** Start with creating the API service layer and fixing TypeScript errors. This will unblock all other work and establish a pattern for the rest of the integrations.
