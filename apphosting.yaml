# For a standard Next.js project, you can often omit buildConfig and entryPoint
# as App Hosting automatically detects and builds Next.js apps.

runConfig:
  # The maximum number of container instances that can be running at a time.
  # Increase this value to automatically spin up more instances
  # in response to increased traffic.
  maxInstances: 2
  # You can also configure CPU, memory, and concurrency.
  # cpu: 1
  # memoryMiB: 512
  # concurrency: 80

# env defines environment variables for the backend.
# It's recommended to use secrets for sensitive data.
# You can set a secret using the Firebase CLI:
# firebase apphosting:secrets:set MY_SECRET_NAME
env:
  - variable: FIREBASE_CONFIG
    value: '{{ env.FIREBASE_CONFIG }}'
  # - variable: MY_API_KEY
  #   secret: MY_SECRET_NAME
