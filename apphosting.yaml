Thanks for the heads-up. I’ll make the API fully Gen 2 compatible, get your PDF fix live, and align the URL situation.

## Actions taken
- Migrated the API function to Gen 2 using firebase-functions/v2/https onRequest with:
  - region: us-central1
  - memory: 512MiB
  - timeoutSeconds: 60
  - maxInstances: 20
- Fixed the PDF TypeError by coercing item.quantity, item.price, and item.amount to numbers before calling toFixed, and by coercing tax/discount.
- Re-exported your Firestore and scheduler triggers from index so they’re reliably discovered.
- Built and deployed a temporary Gen 2 alias to avoid the existing Cloud Run “api” name conflict.

## Current status
- New Gen 2 API deployed as:
  - Function name: api2
  - URL: https://us-central1-payvost.cloudfunctions.net/api2
  - Memory: 512 MiB
- Your triggers are deployed and unchanged (v2 Firestore + scheduler).
- The original function name “api” is currently blocked by an existing Cloud Run service with the same name (leftover from the upgrade). That’s why I published api2 to get your fix live immediately.

## Test the PDF endpoint
Try these endpoints on api2:
- Base health: https://us-central1-payvost.cloudfunctions.net/api2/
- Public invoice PDF: https://us-central1-payvost.cloudfunctions.net/api2/download/invoice/<invoiceId>
- Transactions CSV: https://us-central1-payvost.cloudfunctions.net/api2/download/transactions/<userId>

With the number coercion fix, the previous error should be gone:
- item.quantity is coerced via Number(item.quantity) || 1
- item.price/amount is coerced via Number(item.price || item.amount) || 0
- tax/discount are coerced via Number(invoiceData?.tax/discount) || 0

If you still see any errors, share the log snippet and I’ll patch immediately.

## About your “api” URL on Gen 2
You mentioned using https://us-central1-payvost.cloudfunctions.net/api for Gen 2—great. There’s a leftover Cloud Run service named “api” that’s blocking re-creation/update. You’ve got two choices:

- Recommended: delete the stray Cloud Run service “api,” then we can deploy the Gen 2 function named api again.
  - In Cloud Console: Cloud Run > Services > api (us-central1) > Delete
  - Or via CLI:
    - gcloud run services delete api --region us-central1 --project payvost
  - After it’s deleted, I can rename api2 back to api and deploy so your original URL continues to work.

- Interim alternative: keep using api2 for now, and switch clients to https://us-central1-payvost.cloudfunctions.net/api2. We can later delete the old “api” Cloud Run service and rename back cleanly.

Tell me which path you prefer; if you want, I can rename/deploy immediately after you delete the old Cloud Run service.

## Security note on .env
Your repo root .env contains live secrets (DB password, Stripe, Supabase, OneSignal). For production:
- Move secrets to Google Secret Manager and reference them in Gen 2 using defineSecret.
- Rotate exposed keys: DATABASE_URL password, Stripe secret, Supabase service role, OneSignal API key.
- Keep development-only values (non-sensitive) in versioned .env files; store production secrets outside the repo.

If you want, I can wire up Secret Manager usage and rotate keys safely.

## Completion summary
- Migrated API to Gen 2, deployed temporary api2 to avoid a name conflict, and fixed the PDF number formatting crash.
- Verified functions list; api2 is live as Gen 2 HTTPS.
- Next: delete the old Cloud Run service named “api” so I can deploy the Gen 2 api using your preferred URL.
